```

Our Code seems to be corrupted maybe these notes of our Developer can help you fix it.

```
Run on ubuntu-latest
Then check out the Repository
The `node-version` should be "10.x"
```

```
To build the npm dependencies i need to Change Directory into the  app folder and then run
npm install
npm run build --if-present
npm run test --if-present
```

```
Where did i do this Login before?
```

```
azure/webapps-deploy@v2

Needs the `app-name` and a package location. Where did i store the webapps Name again?
```
# 2. Run your Pipeline

You can try to run your Workflow.
